# HelloWorld
My first Android Application here. I followed this tutorial throughout completing this application: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app/index.html#0

As part of an exploration project, I decided to devote remaining time of school to learn Android Development. Suffice it to say I had a difficult time making "a simple application". I lack the fundamentals of Java and had a hard time following along through the tutorial. I was especially stuck on making a simple Toast appear. 


(The app has 3 buttons: toast, count, and random.

The toast button displays a toast message stating "Hello Toast!".

The count button displays a counter.

The random button displays a random number within the range of 0 and the counter number. If you didn't press the count button before the random button, the app crashes. I honestly don't know how to fix it currently.)

## Thoughts
Overall, I'd say completing this project was pretty helpful because I gained a small inkling of what it's like working on an actual project with a strict deadline. The app isn't top-notch or anything cool, but I'm glad I got my foot in the door of gaining some programming experience, although I STILL have LOTS to learn.
